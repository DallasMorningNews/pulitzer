                    <div class="dropText clearFix">
                        <p><em>The Guardian</em>and <em>Washington Post</em> shared the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their exposure of the surveillance activities of the NSA following the leaks of Edward Snowden. Where does the people’s right to know rub up against government’s responsibility to protect? How do administration officials and journalists navigate these competing interests? It’s a natural tension that transcends party, administration, news organizations. What criteria do administration officials use to determine what to keep classified? Is transparency a double-edged sword? What sorts of guidelines should news organizations employ in discerning what’s newsworthy? </p>
