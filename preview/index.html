                    <h6>Director of <em>The Dallas Morning News’</em> Bridging Dallas’ North-South Gap project</h6>
                    <p>After working at newspapers in New York and Detroit, Sharon Grigsby joined The Dallas Morning News as a young editor who expected to be back in Texas for only a year or two. But landing in the middle of one of the country’s most intensive newspaper wars, she  went on to work in most every nook and cranny of the DMN, including national news, politics, features, religion and local news – culminating in running the Metro operation -- before joining the Editorial Board. Sharon, 59, divides her time these days between writing editorials and directing the department’s “Bridging Dallas’ North-South Gap” project, which won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing. After several decades as an editor, she’s “exceedingly jazzed” to be writing again, especially looking for ways to make Dallas a smarter city.</p>

              <div class="dropText clearFix">
                <p><em>The Guardian</em>and <em>Washington Post</em> shared the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their exposure of the surveillance activities of the NSA following the leaks of Edward Snowden. Where does the people’s right to know rub up against government’s responsibility to protect? How do administration officials and journalists navigate these competing interests? It’s a natural tension that transcends party, administration, news organizations. What criteria do administration officials use to determine what to keep classified? Is transparency a double-edged sword? What sorts of guidelines should news organizations employ in discerning what’s newsworthy?  </p>

              <div class="dropText clearFix">
                <p>Are American politics today more polarized than ever before? Why is that? Or if not, why does it seem so? Is this good or bad? Is our democracy eroding in the face of demographic fracturing, increased class warfare and exacerbating fear and distrust? What can/should our leaders do about it? What can we do about it?</p>
