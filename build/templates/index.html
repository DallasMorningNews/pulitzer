                <p>In the digital age, when anyone can tweet a breaking news headline or blog a public-affairs anyalysis, news organizations are changing how they cover news. Similarly, political leaders make use of digital tools, including social media, to bypass traditional media "gatekeepers" and communicate directly with targeted, usually like-minded, people. This panel looks at the impact of this digital phenomenon on coverage, presidential action and public opinion.</p>

                <p>A succession of presidents have made fighting poverty and helping impoverished Americans confront and overcome poverty a top issue of their administration. This panel features former administration officials and prize-winning journalists who have wrestled with these issues. We focus the discussion on domestic poverty and its implications, the growing income disparity in the U.S., poverty's impact on real people and how it shapes communities.</p>

                <p><em>The Guardian</em>and <em>Washington Post</em> shared the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their exposure of the surveillance activities of the NSA following the leaks of Edward Snowden. Where does the people’s right to know rub up against government’s responsibility to protect? How do administration officials and journalists navigate these competing interests? It’s a natural tension that transcends party, administration, news organizations. What criteria do administration officials use to determine what to keep classified? Is transparency a double-edged sword? What sorts of guidelines should news organizations employ in discerning what’s newsworthy?  </p>

                <p>Are American politics today more polarized than ever before? Why is that? Or if not, why does it seem so? Is this good or bad? Is our democracy eroding in the face of demographic fracturing, increased class warfare and exacerbating fear and distrust? What can/should our leaders do about it? What can we do about it?</p>
